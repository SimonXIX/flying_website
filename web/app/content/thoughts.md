I can do this. 

I am prepared for this and able to handle this.

Anything that happens is a step forward.

My goals align with getting on this flight.

Feel your feelings. Even your anxiety.

You can't rationalise your feelings if you don't acknowledge how it feels. 

Be reflective, realistic, and let yourself feel it.

It's like driving: you have the skills now. Don't be put off by a stall.

This is something you can get better at.

Focus on what you want to do when you get to your destination.

I want to get on a plane so I can travel more.

I want to get on a plane to travel with my partner.

I want to go back to Italy.

I can remake the cognitive and emotional associations around flying. 

Flying is boring and travel is tedious and it's OK to feel anxious about it. 

It's OK to be a nervous flyer.

Feel the fear and do it anyway.

Anxiety will hit like a wave and that's OK. You're learning to surf it.

All discomfort is only temporary.

It's an hour or so of discomfort: just like at the dentist, you can handle a limited time of discomfort. 

Physical sensations like stomach dropping and feeling light-headed are something that childen consider good sensations and often purposely bring on.

The physical sensations themselves are not the problem: it's the way we *interpret* them that makes them scary and uncomfortable.

Your interpretation of your physical sensations is something that can be changed. 

When seated, remember to adopt a relaxed posture. Release the tension in your body. 

"I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."
