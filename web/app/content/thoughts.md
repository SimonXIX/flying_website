Your interpretation of your physical sensations is something that can be changed. 

It's an hour or so of discomfort: just like at the dentist, you can handle a limited time of discomfort. 

When seated, remember to adopt a relaxed posture. Release the tension in your body.

And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
Only I will remain."
