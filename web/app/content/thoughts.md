I can do this. 

I am prepared for this and able to handle this.

I want to get on a plane so I can travel more.

I want to get on a plane to travel with my partner.

I want to go back to Italy.

I can remake the cognitive and emotional associations around flying. 

Flying is boring and travel is tedious and it's OK to feel anxious about it. 

It's OK to be a nervous flyer.

Anxiety will hit like a wave and that's OK. 

All discomfort is only temporary.

It's an hour or so of discomfort: just like at the dentist, you can handle a limited time of discomfort. 

Physical sensations like stomach dropping and feeling light-headed are something that childen consider good sensations and often purposely bring on.

The physical sensations themselves are not the problem: it's the way we *interpret* them that makes them scary and uncomfortable.

Your interpretation of your physical sensations is something that can be changed. 

When seated, remember to adopt a relaxed posture. Release the tension in your body. 

"I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."
