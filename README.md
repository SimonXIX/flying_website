# Simon's flying support site

## about

This website is a resource constructed as part of my cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for fear of flying. This therapy was provided by [Wellbeing Services South Glasgow](https://www.wellbeing-glasgow.org.uk/), a Primary Care Mental Health service funded by NHS Scotland. 

The site is structured around a series of alternative thoughts, affirmations, and helpful phrases as well as a multimedia guide to the various sounds experienced on a commercial airliner. 

Please note that this resource is designed to help me specifically and may not offer the same benefits to others. CBT is an individualised talking therapy where outputs are geared towards the cognitive and emotional patterns of a particular individual and so they may not offer the same benefits to other people.

The sounds guide is based on:
